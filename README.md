## üß© Overview

This repository explores and implements advanced computer vision algorithms that integrate **classical image processing** with **deep learning**.  
Projects emphasize reproducibility, real-time performance, and modular design for research and production environments.

### **Coin Detection and Classification**
A live detection system that processes video to identify, classify, and assign values to coins in real time.  
It integrates adaptive preprocessing (CLAHE, Gaussian blur), background subtraction, Hough circle transforms, and contour analysis with a custom CNN to achieve robust detection and ~10% accuracy improvements over heuristic methods.  
A classical fallback mode is included when no CNN is provided.

### **Other Image Processing Modules**
Additional modules include experiments in color space transformations, morphological filtering, and edge detection ‚Äî forming a versatile toolkit for both research and applied development.


## üß± Architecture

The repository is designed with modularity and extensibility in mind:

- **Classical CV Techniques ‚Üí** Implements proven methods such as Hough transforms, background subtraction, and contour analysis for feature extraction.  
- **Deep Learning Integration ‚Üí** Optional CNNs (TensorFlow/Keras) enhance classification accuracy and adaptability.  
- **Robust Preprocessing ‚Üí** Adaptive algorithms like CLAHE ensure consistent performance under fluctuating lighting.  
- **Separation of Concerns ‚Üí** Each module (e.g., coin detection, color transformations) is independently testable and integrable.


## üß† Highlighted Projects
